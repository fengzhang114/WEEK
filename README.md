I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Liberty project and grow within the IT Engineering team. Over the past year, I’ve taken on additional responsibilities, especially during the period when a senior resource was unavailable. I led Liberty-related development and deployment activities, supported integration with SiteMinder, and participated in troubleshooting complex configuration issues. I also started working on the new OpenShift-based deployment pipeline, which helped me expand my skills in cloud-native application support.

I appreciate the trust placed in me by my manager and the collaborative environment fostered by the team. I’ve learned a great deal from working independently and from the helpful guidance of senior teammates. While I continue to improve in areas such as reporting and documentation, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made in understanding system architecture, security integration, and enterprise deployment processes.

I look forward to continuing to grow in this role, taking on new challenges, and supporting upcoming projects. I’m also happy to mentor others who are new to the team, just as others have helped me.
