2. TTNF Activation Issue in RDL2
	•	Task: Investigate the TTNF (Test to New Function) activation issue in the RDL2 environment.
	•	Progress:
	•	Held multiple calls with Jiaming. Identified that although the status has changed to Finished, the “Generate Notification Code” button remains in blue and does not activate.
	•	Involved BU versions include:
	•	PIPINT (OC1), PIPINT_R2235_7, PIPWS_R2235_6, PIPEXTWS,
PIPEXTWS_R680_MR1814_1, PIPEXT (SC1), PIPEXT_R2235_7,
PIPASYNC (LR1), PIPASYNC_R2235_5
	•	Action Taken:
	•	Terry suggested checking with Jiaming or Fei for comparison, as Fei reportedly got it working.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Collaborate with the development team to investigate the cause and fix the issue with the activation code button logic.
