Security Configuration & Role Mapping:

Debugged and refined role-to-group mapping in IBM Application BND.
Verified security constraints and role bindings in web.xml and application.xml.
Analyzed WebSphere Liberty logs to confirm group-role mapping and authentication issues.
Application Deployment & Configuration:

Identified duplicate EAR files under the expanded directory and investigated deployment behavior.
Adjusted server.xml configurations to ensure correct application bindings.
Troubleshooting Authentication & Authorization Issues:

Debugged user login failures related to missing role assignments.
Used dump_headers.jsp to extract request headers for further analysis.
Modified security-constraint to allow authentication before role validation.

Deployment Issues:

Resolved EAR deployment inconsistencies and improved startup logs monitoring.
Ensured that role-based access control works as expected.
Logging & Debugging:

Enhanced log analysis techniques using less and case-insensitive search.
Examined server logs for authorization failures and missing role mappings.
Process Optimization:

Implemented automated debugging tools to quickly inspect authentication headers.
Explored ways to streamline Maven builds while preserving manually configured application.xml.
Next Steps:
Finalize authentication debugging and role assignments.
Validate security constraints for additional application endpoints.
Optimize deployment process to prevent duplicate EAR files.
