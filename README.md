Weekly Report

This week, I worked through several important technical areas:

EZPT - TTNF Authentication Investigation
I reviewed the TTNF authentication flow in the EZPT system. After analyzing logs and configuration files, I identified issues causing authentication failures and proposed corrections to streamline the process.

GQIG - Session Management Adjustment
I focused on session creation, validation, and expiration for GQIG. Adjustments were made to ensure proper session persistence after authentication, reducing unauthorized session errors.

Configuration and Environment Setup
I updated Liberty server configurations, optimized JVM options, and refined security settings to support session and credential passing with SiteMinder.

Log Analysis and Debugging
I actively analyzed message logs, HTTP traces, and debug outputs to trace authentication behavior. Session and role mappings were carefully verified against SiteMinder headers.

Broadcom Sample Reference Integration
I reviewed Broadcom sample EAR structures and successfully adapted critical settings to our application environment to ensure compliance with SiteMinder integration.

Planning for Scripted Testing
Final authentication validation and session mapping work will be completed next week together with SSC. After that, scripting for automated testing will be scheduled to ensure end-to-end verification.

Conclusion:
Authentication configuration is now accurate. Next week, I will complete final validation jointly with SSC, and plan to start writing automation scripts for comprehensive testing.
