Work Summary
WebSphere Liberty Application Deployment

Successfully deployed the Liberty Default Application EAR file and performed related configurations.
Studied server.xml and ibm-application-bnd.xml to support SiteMinder authentication.
Implemented FORM authentication for the Liberty application's login page.
SiteMinder Integration Debugging

Researched the SiteMinder Login Module workflow.
Verified LDAP directory structure and ensured correct user and group mapping to Liberty.
Debugged logs and analyzed issues related to SM_UNIVERSALID header not found and group permissions.
Security Access Control Configuration

Modified ibm-application-bnd.xml to properly map Liberty roles with SiteMinder user groups.
Studied web.xml security-constraint to ensure restricted page access based on authentication.
Configured application.xml and META-INF to properly define WAR context paths to align with business requirements.
Log Analysis & Issue Troubleshooting

Used Spring Security Debugger to analyze the user authentication flow.
Identified issues where modifying configuration files inside an extracted EAR package caused compatibility problems when re-packaging using WinZip.
Resolved missing SiteMinder group information in logs by adjusting mappings in ibm-application-bnd.xml.
Issues & Solutions
Issue	Solution
SM_UNIVERSALID header not found	Checked if SiteMinder is properly injecting HTTP headers and debugged WebSphere filters.
Liberty unable to retrieve SiteMinder group information	Ensured correct role binding in ibm-application-bnd.xml and properly defined security-role in web.xml.
EAR re-packaging failure	Used jar -cvf instead of WinZip to properly repackage and deploy the EAR file.
Next Week's Plan
Finalize testing of Liberty authentication and authorization, ensuring correct SiteMinder group mapping.
Optimize logging and error handling, reducing WARN and ERROR log outputs for a cleaner debugging process.
Deploy the final application version and verify role-based access control for security compliance.
Document the SiteMinder-Liberty authentication integration process, summarizing debugging experiences for future maintenance.
